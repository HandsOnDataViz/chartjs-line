# Line Chart with One or More Series in Chart.js

![Line chart with any number of series](./line.png)

## Demo 
https://handsondataviz.github.io/chartjs-line/

Sample data by CT Department of Education.

## Create your own
See chapter 10: Chart.js and Highcharts templates in [Hands-On Data Visualization](https://handsondataviz.org) by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou.

In `data.csv`, each row is a point in time (x-axis). Each column is a new series.
There can be any number of points in time (rows) and any number of series (columns).

The first column is always labels for the x-axis. Second and all other
columns are new series (lines), whose label is taken from the first row (header).

You can modify source and credits (lines that appear below the chart) in `index.html`.

In `script.js`, you can customize the values of variables shown in the code snippet below. For more customization, see [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/).

```javascript
var TITLE = 'Hartford School District is No Longer Largest in Connecticut';

// x-axis label and label in tooltip
var X_AXIS = 'Academic Year';

// y-axis label and label in tooltip
var Y_AXIS = 'Number of Students'; 

// Should y-axis start from 0? `true` or `false`
var BEGIN_AT_ZERO = false;

// `true` to show the grid, `false` to hide
var SHOW_GRID = true;

 // `true` to show the legend, `false` to hide
var SHOW_LEGEND = true;
```

**Colors** are assigned to lines automatically based on a qualitative color scheme
from [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/). The example contains 5 lines,
so a color scheme with 5 colors was chosen. Based on your data, you can choose your color
scheme at the bottom of `script.js` from any of the following:
https://nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/colorchart.html

```javascript
colorschemes: {
  /*
    Replace below with any other color scheme from
    https://nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/colorchart.html
   */
  scheme: 'brewer.DarkTwo5'
}
```

If you want to **make your Y-axis scale more granular** with more ticks, [consider increasing
`maxTicksLimit` value](https://github.com/HandsOnDataViz/chartjs-line/blob/master/script.js#L78).

To change how values appear in the tooltip or on x- and y- axes, for example to add a dollar sign `$`
before monetary values, modify callbacks, such as this:

```javascript
callback: function(value, index, values) {
  return '$' + value.toLocaleString();
}
```

## Why am I not seeing my chart when I open `index.html` in the browser?
This error is known as cross-origin request error. When you double-click the file to open locally in your browser, you will see the URL in the address bar starting with `file:`, and all attempts to read a local CSV file, even though it is located in the same folder, will fail.

Here are a few ideas how to go around it:
* Find out how to disable same-origin policy in your browser (to start with, see [this blog post](https://alfilatov.com/posts/run-chrome-without-cors/) or [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome)).
* Install a program that will emulate a local server on your device, such as `live-server`(https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
* Move your CSV files to a remote location on the web (such as GitHub Gist, AWS S3, or a Wordpress site), and in script.js, change `$.get('./data.csv', function(csvString) {` to `$.get('https://wherever.your/file/is/data.csv', function(csvString) {`.
* Do all the development (file modifications) within GitHub without downloading this repository, using either GitHub's web interface, or GitHub Desktop application.
